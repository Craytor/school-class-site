				<h2>Accessibility Review of the Girard School District Home Page</h2>
				<h5>Navigation and Orientation <small>72% Pass</small></h5>
				<p>The navigation and orientation of the site is horrible, both being my opinion, but also the truth showed by <em>WAVE</em>. The site doesn't have any formal organization, pages are just linked to one another and it would be hard for a person with dissabilities to navigate the site.</p>
				<h5>Text Equivalents <small>95% Pass</small></h5>
				<p>In most areas on the site, a text equivalent is shown. By this I mean that there is alt text shown for most links and images on the site. Also, there is alt-text on most navigation text.</p>
				<h5>Scripting <small>100% Pass</small></h5>
				<p>The site passed with 100% acceptance in the scripting testing area. But, in terms of the site, I don't think the site uses much javascript, and therefore I think that the results could have been skewed.</p>
				<h5>Styling <small>90% Pass</small></h5>
				<p>The overall styling of the site was decent, but there were some issues. Some of the issues were "simple" issues that included font and center selectors, bold styling issues, using 'i' instead of em, etc. A lot of these changes could be fixed with some simple knowledge.</p>
				<h5>HTML Standards <small>90% Pass</small></h5>
				<p>The only main issue with the site is that it didn't have the content type set and also, it didn't have the doctype for HTML 5.</p>
